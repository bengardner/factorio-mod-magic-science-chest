# Magic Science Pack Chest Factorio Mod

## Overview

This mod adds a chest named "Magic Science Pack Chest" that automatically
refills with all researched and produced science packs.

This is obviously a cheat.

To make it a bit less of a cheat, the amount it fills each chest is limited
to the number of items created by the force. This looks at the input
item statistics.
So, you still need to produce several of each science pack.
